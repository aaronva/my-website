    <h3>Untitled Game
        <div class="version">1.0</div>
    </h3>
    <p class="description">
	This is a game I developed with the intent of exploring Unity and general game development. While it is a 2D game
        from a game play perspective, I instead used 3D logic to practice working a bit more with full vectors. The
        game suffers a bit from lack of artistic support; when I pick up this project again, getting some better audio
        and art assets will be an important goal.

    <p class="description">
	This is a quick game I developed as an assignment for a course I took on color. It is a fairly
	simple game with unpolished UI, but it's fun to play around with for a bit once you figure
	out the interface.

        It's a simple game built around the concept of only using a single button and features you protecting a chicken

    <h3>League of Legends Magic Cards

    </h3>
    <p class="description">This is a project where I attempt to put all 120+ League of Legends champions into the form
	of a Magic: the Gathering cards. I eventually came to the conclusion that when I shared all
	of them, 120 cards would be too much at once, so I split them up into 3 groups so that there'd
	be less overwhelming information and some hype.</p>

    <h3>Marvel Avenger's Commander Deck
        <div class="version">On Hiatus</div>
    </h3>
    <p class="description">
        This is a Commander Deck I am building drawing inspiration from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
        I've played the deck a couple times with my friends, and I discovered that the deck still needs some
        cohesion. There are definitely a couple cool cards that should inspire their own decks, but I really want this
        deck to be viable on it's own. Fortunately there are a couple empty slots in the deck that can serve make the
        deck function as a whole, and the commander himself can get a tweak to push that direction.
