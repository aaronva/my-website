    <h3>Marvel Avenger's Commander Deck</h3>
    <p class="description">
        This is a Commander Deck I am building drawing inspiration from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
        I've played the deck a couple times with my friends, and I discovered that the deck still needs some
        cohesion. There are definitely a couple cool cards that should inspire their own decks, but I really want this
        deck to be viable on it's own. Fortunately there are a couple empty slots in the deck that can serve make the
        deck function as a whole, and the commander himself can get a tweak to push that direction.
