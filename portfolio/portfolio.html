    <h3>Shelter Spinner
        <div class="version">v1.0</div>
    </h3>
    <p class="description">
	This is a game I developed with the intent of exploring Unity and general game development. While it is a 2D game
        from a game play perspective, I instead used 3D logic to practice working a bit more with full vectors. The
        game suffers a bit from lack of artistic support; when I pick up this project again, getting some better audio
        and art assets will be an important goal.

    <h3>Color Game

    <p class="description">
	This is a quick game I developed as an assignment for a course I took on color. It is a fairly
	simple game with unpolished UI, but it's fun to play around with for a bit once you figure
	out the interface.

        It's a simple game built around the concept of only using a single button and features you protecting a chicken
        by rotating the oncoming planets out of the way.</p>

    This website! It's probably over-engineered for what it's doing (it perhaps doesn't <em>really</em> need Angular),

    <h3>Marvel Avenger's Commander Deck

    <p class="description">
        This one also involves making custom magic cards. Rather than an unorganized mess, this is a specific deck I am
        designing for the characters Marvel Cinematic Universe. (For those that are interested it's a commander deck.)
        Check out the repo and the readme for more information.
