    I'm a 23 year old student about to graduate from the University of Waterloo in August. I love playing games
    and enjoy designing them too. I really like fantasy and sci-fi stories and love diving into expansive lore and
    interconnected stories, regardless of the medium. I will often have fun trying to re-imagine characters in
    different settings or games and practiced capturing characters in mechanics.

    I am also fascinated by non-game design too. I love combining technical knowledge with understanding of people's
    perceptions and enjoy employing psychological concepts in a way that I like to think of as
    "tricking people to help them."
