<h2>About Me>
<p>
I am a recent graduate of University of Waterloo’s Computer Science program. 
I have programming experience in a wide variety of languages and technologies largely through University of Waterloo’s co-operative program as courses. 
I’m proficient in a wide array of programming languages including C++, C#, Java, Python, and JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
Additionally I have gotten quite proficient in Git, evening having used it for a couple non-programming projects (see below). 
</p>
<h3>Interests</h3>
<p>I am probably a very good example of a nerd. 
If I enjoy something, I will go all in, spending weeks or months diving into that thing until something else catches my eye.
</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, games are probably the main media that I am interested in. 
I love many aspects about them; depending on the game, I’ll spend a lot of time focusing on the design of the game, the metagame, the story, the mechanics, or something else.
</p>
<p>Outside of games, I have interest in some other media such as books and television, as well as more general interests such as programming, politics and Japanese language/culture.
